## Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment Validation
- [ ] Run validation script: `npm run validate:prod`
- [ ] Verify all required files present
- [ ] Check Docker configuration: `docker-compose config`
- [ ] Test build process: `npm run build:prod`

### Backup and Safety
- [ ] Create database backup (if existing deployment)
- [ ] Document current system state
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of deployment window

### Deployment Execution
- [ ] Run deployment script: `npm run deploy:prod:full`
- [ ] Monitor deployment logs for errors
- [ ] Verify all containers start successfully
- [ ] Check container health status: `docker-compose ps`

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Health checks pass for all services
  - [ ] Frontend: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
  - [ ] Backend: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
  - [ ] Database: MongoDB connection test
- [ ] Smoke tests pass
  - [ ] Search API: `curl "http://localhost:3001/api/search?query=test"`
  - [ ] Frontend loads correctly
  - [ ] Trie visualization works
- [ ] Performance tests pass
  - [ ] Response times < 100ms for search
  - [ ] Memory usage within limits
  - [ ] No memory leaks detected

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Log aggregation configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled
- [ ] Health check alerts configured
- [ ] Backup schedule verified
- [ ] SSL certificate expiration monitoring (if applicable)

### Documentation
- [ ] Deployment notes documented
- [ ] Configuration changes recorded
- [ ] Known issues documented
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented

### Communication
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of successful deployment
- [ ] Support team briefed on new features/changes
- [ ] Documentation updated with new endpoints/features

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Container Won't Start
```bash
# Check logs
docker-compose logs [service-name]

# Check resource usage
docker stats

# Verify configuration
docker-compose config
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test MongoDB connection
docker exec -it autocomplete-mongodb-prod mongosh

# Check network connectivity
docker network inspect autocomplete-network
```

#### Frontend Not Loading
```bash
# Check nginx configuration
docker exec -it autocomplete-frontend-prod nginx -t

# Verify build files
docker exec -it autocomplete-frontend-prod ls -la /usr/share/nginx/html
```

#### API Errors
```bash
# Check backend logs
docker-compose logs autocomplete-backend-prod

# Test API endpoints
curl -v http://localhost:3001/api/search?query=test
```

### Performance Issues
- Check memory usage: `docker stats`
- Monitor response times: Check `/api/performance` endpoint
- Review application logs for bottlenecks
- Verify database indexes and query performance

### Security Issues
- Verify SSL certificate validity
- Check security headers: `curl -I https://your-domain.com`
- Review access logs for suspicious activity
- Ensure all services use strong authentication

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback
The deployment script includes automatic rollback on failure. To disable:
```bash
./scripts/production-deploy.sh --no-rollback
```

### Manual Rollback
1. Stop current deployment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
   ```

2. Restore database backup:
   ```bash
   # List available backups
   ls -la backups/
   
   # Restore from backup
   docker exec -i autocomplete-mongodb-prod mongorestore --archive --gzip < backups/mongodb-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.gz
   ```

3. Deploy previous version:
   ```bash
   git checkout [previous-tag]
   ./scripts/production-deploy.sh
   ```

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily
- [ ] Check application logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Verify all services are running

### Weekly
- [ ] Review performance metrics
- [ ] Check backup integrity
- [ ] Update security patches (if available)
- [ ] Clean up old log files

### Monthly
- [ ] Update base Docker images
- [ ] Review and rotate logs
- [ ] Performance optimization review
- [ ] Security audit

### Quarterly
- [ ] Disaster recovery testing
- [ ] Capacity planning review
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Useful Commands

### Docker Management
```bash
# View all containers
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]

# Restart service
docker-compose restart [service-name]

# Update and restart
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

### System Monitoring
```bash
# Check system resources
htop
df -h
free -h

# Check network connections
netstat -tulpn

# Check service status
systemctl status docker
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Connect to MongoDB
docker exec -it autocomplete-mongodb-prod mongosh

# Create backup
docker exec autocomplete-mongodb-prod mongodump --archive --gzip --db autocomplete-search > backup.gz

# Restore backup
docker exec -i autocomplete-mongodb-prod mongorestore --archive --gzip < backup.gz
```

## Success Criteria

Deployment is considered successful when:

- [ ] All containers are running and healthy
- [ ] All health endpoints return 200 status
- [ ] Search functionality works correctly
- [ ] Response times are within acceptable limits (< 100ms)
- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] SSL certificate is valid (if using HTTPS)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are functional
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
